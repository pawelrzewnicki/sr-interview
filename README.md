# Live Football World Cup Scoreboard

## Overview

This Java library was developed as part of a coding interview challenge. The project simulates a live football World Cup scoreboard that displays all the ongoing matches and their scores. The primary assumption during development was to keep the solution as simple as possible while demonstrating good software engineering principles.

## Features

The scoreboard supports the following operations:

- Start a new match with the initial score of 0 - 0.
- Update the score of an ongoing match.
- Finish a match currently in progress.
- Get a summary of matches in progress, ordered by their total score.

Please refer to the code documentation for usage examples.

## Development

The project emphasizes Object-Oriented design principles, Clean Code principles, and SOLID principles to ensure high code quality. While the project was kept simple for the purposes of the interview, these principles make the design robust and extensible.

## Running Tests

This project uses JUnit for testing. You can run the tests using the appropriate command in your build system or IDE.

## Built With

- Java
- JUnit

## Note

This project was developed as a coding interview challenge. The main goal was to keep the solution simple and straightforward, while incorporating best practices in software development such as OO design, Clean Code, and SOLID principles.
